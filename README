compile cmd:

g++ -o TowersFinalExeEmpress Towers-WO-WP.cpp

The program was written in C++ and was concerned with weighted values with in f(x) = g(x) + h(x). 
h(x) was the most critical element within this project because it would predict 
how many more moves it would take to reach a goal state. 
g(x) was the total amount of used moved and f(x) would simply represent the total. 
This was my final project for my Graduate Level Artificial Intelligence class.
